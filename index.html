      <h2 class="fade-in">Using Earth Observation to Plan Resilient Cities</h2>
      <p class="fade-in">
        This article synthesizes scientific evidence on urban habitats, pollution, resource management and climate-driven risks.
        It describes how planners can integrate satellite Earth observation data to create adaptive, equitable and low-impact urban growth strategies.
      </p>

      <p class="fade-in">
        Earth observation technologies provide critical insights into air quality, vegetation health, surface temperature, and hydrological cycles.
        Urban expansion modifies these systems, often in ways that amplify vulnerability to floods, heatwaves, and pollution exposure.
      </p>

      <p class="fade-in">
        Operationalizing this information involves three linked steps: measurement, synthesis, and action. First, consistent monitoring identifies trends and anomalies. Second, synthesis integrates multiple indicators into dashboards and spatial risk maps. Third, action translates insights into zoning, green infrastructure investments, emergency planning, and inclusive policies that prioritize marginalized neighborhoods.

      <p class="fade-in">
        Transparent metrics and community engagement are essential to ensure interventions reduce inequities rather than reinforce them. In conclusion, the integration of Earth observation with local knowledge and policy frameworks provides a path toward resilient urban futures.

      <h2 class="fade-in">Historical Evolution of Cities</h2>
      <p class="fade-in">
        Cities have evolved from small trading hubs in Mesopotamia to sprawling megacities in the 21st century. Early cities were organized around rivers and fertile lands, offering trade opportunities and agriculture. During the industrial revolution, cities became engines of economic growth but also sources of pollution and inequality. In the 20th century, urbanization accelerated globally, particularly in the Global South, where rapid population growth often outpaced infrastructure development.
      </p>

      <h2 class="fade-in">Impact of Pollution on Public Health</h2>
      <p class="fade-in">
        Air pollution remains one of the leading causes of premature deaths worldwide. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) penetrates deep into the lungs and bloodstream, causing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Noise pollution contributes to stress and cognitive decline, while water contamination spreads infectious diseases. By integrating environmental data with health statistics, policymakers can target interventions in neighborhoods most at risk.
      </p>

      <h2 class="fade-in">Practical Solutions for Sustainable Futures</h2>
      <p class="fade-in">
        Building sustainable cities requires interventions that integrate ecological, social, and technological dimensions. Green infrastructure—such as urban forests, green roofs, and permeable pavements—provides natural cooling, reduces stormwater runoff, and enhances biodiversity within dense metropolitan areas. Renewable energy adoption, particularly solar and wind power, can be integrated into distributed microgrids to reduce fossil fuel dependency.
      </p>

      <h2 class="fade-in">Emerging Technologies: AI and IoT</h2>
      <p class="fade-in">
        Artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things (IoT) are revolutionizing how cities function. Sensors embedded in traffic lights, water systems, and buildings collect real-time data. AI algorithms analyze this data to optimize traffic flows, detect leaks, or predict energy demand. Smart cities such as Singapore and Barcelona already deploy these technologies to improve efficiency and sustainability.
      </p>

      <h2 class="fade-in">Global Examples of Innovation</h2>
      <p class="fade-in">
        Copenhagen has committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2025 through wind energy and cycling infrastructure. Kigali in Rwanda has banned plastic bags and promotes green mobility. Curitiba in Brazil pioneered bus rapid transit, inspiring similar systems worldwide. These examples show that both developed and developing nations can lead in climate-smart urban planning.
      </p>

      <h2 class="fade-in">Future of Cities in 2100</h2>
      <p class="fade-in">
        By the year 2100, cities will likely merge into vast "urban corridors" where megacities connect across regions. Floating cities may emerge in response to rising sea levels, using renewable energy and circular economies. Underground and vertical cities could become a reality, maximizing land use while minimizing environmental impact. Technology will be central, but the ultimate success of these futures will depend on equitable governance and respect for planetary boundaries.
